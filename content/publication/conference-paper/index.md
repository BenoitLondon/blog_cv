abstract: Online soccer betting has become a complex continuous-time market. Hence, the need for continuous time and sophisticated models is obvious as the original simple Poisson model of Maher is not able to reproduce the prices and dynamics that we observe in the market. In order to price bets more accurately, Dixon and Robinson proposed some modulated Poisson processes for goals. Nevertheless, as there are few closed-form for most liquid bets, they chose to calibrate their model historically. We generalize their models and describe a procedure to calibrate the prices implicitely from a set of basic bets prices. Our main result is the expressions of prices of correct score bets in this model.
